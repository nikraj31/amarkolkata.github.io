            <p>&bull;Sourav Chandidas Ganguly was born on the eight of July 1972. He lives in Kolkatta, India. He is a left-handed batsman and a right-handed medium-pace bowler. Ganguly is naturally right-handed, but became a left-handed batsman at a young age so that he could use his brother, Snehasishâ€™s cricket equipment. His fans are grateful for it, because there are few things in cricket that can outshine a Ganguly left-handed drive. He is fondly called as the Prince of Kolkata.</p>
